<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The function is called with the input-output object and the data as arguments.</p>
<p>If the function returns an error object then the error is printed to the standard error stream.</p>
<p>If the function returns a value then the value is ignored.</p>
<p>If the function returns two values then the first value is ignored and the second value is used as the new input-output object.</p>
<p>If the function returns three values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object and the third value is ignored.</p>
<p>If the function returns four values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored and the fourth value is used as the new data.</p>
<p>If the function returns five values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored, the fourth value is used as the new data and the fifth value is ignored.</p>
<p>If the function returns six values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored, the fourth value is used as the new data, the fifth value is ignored and the sixth value is used as the new function.</p>
<p>If the function returns seven values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored, the fourth value is used as the new data, the fifth value is ignored, the sixth value is used as the new function and the seventh value is ignored.</p>
<p>If the function returns eight values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored, the fourth value is used as the new data, the fifth value is ignored, the sixth value is used as the new function, the seventh value is ignored and the eighth value is used as the new time.</p>
<p>If the function returns nine values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored, the fourth value is used as the new data, the fifth value is ignored, the sixth value is used as the new function, the seventh value is ignored, the eighth value is used as the new time and the ninth value is ignored.</p>
<p>If the function returns ten values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored, the fourth value is used as the new data, the fifth value is ignored, the sixth value is used as the new function, the seventh value is ignored, the eighth value is used as the new time, the ninth value is ignored and the tenth value is used as the new job number.</p>
<p>If the function returns more than ten values then the first value is ignored, the second value is used as the new input-output object, the third value is ignored, the fourth value is used as the new data, the fifth value is ignored, the sixth value is used as the new function, the seventh value is ignored, the eighth value is used as the new time, the ninth value is ignored, the tenth value is used as the new job number and the remaining values are ignored.</p>
<p>If the function returns an error object then the error is printed to the standard error stream.</p>
<p>If the function returns a value then the value is ignored.</p>
<p>If the function returns two values then the first value is ignored and the second value is used as the new input-output object.</p>
