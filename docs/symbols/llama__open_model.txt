# llama::open_model (an I/O-function)

  opens a model

  Parameters:
    model_filename: the filename of the model to open

  Result:
    a model object

  **This function must be called with I/O-access rights!**

  The server is instructed to load the specified model (if it is not already
  loaded). Then some model specific meta data is retrieved from the server (e.g.
  the pieces corresponding to the model's tokens) and stored locally in a
  <llama_types::model> object which is returned to the caller.

    if
      model.is_an_error:
	eprintln! "Error: " model.to_error_message_string
	exit! EXIT_FAILURE
      :
	println! "Model opened successfully."
