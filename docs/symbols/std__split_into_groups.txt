# std::split_into_groups (a function)

  splits already indented lines into groups

  Parameters:
    lines: the indented lines
    keep_empty_lines: if true then empty lines are kept

  Result:
    groups: a list of indented lines where each line has a *subgroups*-attribute
    which is itself a list of "indented lines"

  The division into subgroups is only done on the top-level! The subgroups
  do not contain any further subgroups.

    $text "
      a
        1
        2
        3
      b
        4
        5
    $lines split_into_indented_lines(text)
    $groups split_into_groups(lines)
    dump! 3 `groups
    dump! 3 `subgroups_of(groups(1))

  Output:

    groups:
      list
        tuple
          0
          "a@0xa;"
        tuple
          0
          "b@0xa;"
    subgroups_of(groups(1)):
      list
        tuple
          2
          "1@0xa;"
        tuple
          2
          "2@0xa;"
        tuple
          2
          "3@0xa;"
