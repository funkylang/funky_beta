# std_types::hash_table/std::reduce (a method)

  computes a kind of sum from the values stored in the table

  Parameters:
    self: the table to work on
    function: the function to apply to pairs of values
    unit: the value to return for empty tables

  Result:
    value: the reduced value

  There is no guarantee in which order the values will be reduced (folded).

  So the reduction function must obey to the law of assosiativity!
