# std::create_vertical_panes (a function)

  creates a set of vertical panes based on the given screen

  Parameters:
    screen: the screen to base the panes on
    pane_description: a list of pane widths or a number of panes

  Result:
    a list of views

  The *pane_description* can be a number of panes or a list of pane widths.
  If it is a number, then the screen is divided into that many equal-width
  panes. If it is a list, then each element of the list specifies the width
  of a pane. A negative number in the list indicates a flexible pane that
  takes up the remaining space.
