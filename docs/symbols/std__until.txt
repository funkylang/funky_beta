# std::until (a polymorphic function)

  returns the substring until (including) the specified expression

  Parameters:
    str: the input string
    expr: the expression to look for
    nth: look for the nth occurrence of *expr* instead for the first one

  Result:
    string: the substring until (including) the specified expression

  If the specified expression is found within the string the substring
  until the expression is returned. Otherwise the empty string is returned.

  If *nth* is specified then the nth occurence of the expression *expr*
  is looked for. If there are not at least *n* matches for *expr* within *str*
  then the empty string is returned.

  A very similar function is <string/truncate_behind>. It behaves differently
  only when the expression is *not* found.

  Example:

    $identifier "std::until"
    $first_part identifier .until. '.'
    println! '<' first_part '>

  Output:
