# std_types::string/std::truncate_behind (a method)

  returns the substring ending with the specified expression

  Parameters:
    self: the string to truncate
    expr: the expression to look for
    nth: look for the nth occurrence of *expr* instead for the first one

  Result:
    string: the truncated string

  If the string contains the expression the substring ending with the first
  match of the expression is returned.

  If the string does not contain the expression then the string is returned
  without alteration.

  An optional third argument can be used to match the *nth* occurence of
  the specified expression. If this value is negative then -1 means the
  last occurrence, -2 means the next-to-last occurence and so on.
