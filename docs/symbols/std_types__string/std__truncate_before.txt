# std_types::string/std::truncate_before (a method)

  returns the substring starting with the specified expression

  Parameters:
    self: the string to truncate
    expr: the expression to look for
    nth: look for the nth occurrence of *expr* instead for the first one

  Result:
    string: the substring starting with the expression

  If the specified expression is found within the string the substring
  starting with the expression is returned. Otherwise the string is returned
  unaltered.

  If *nth* is specified then the nth occurence of the expression *expr* is
  looked for. If there are not at least *n* matches for *expr* within *str*
  then the string is returned unaltered.

  A very similar function is <string/from>. It behaves differently only when
  the expression is *not* found.
