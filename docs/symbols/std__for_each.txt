# std::for_each (a polymorphic function)

  iterates over all items of a collection

  Parameters:
    self: the collection to iterate over
    body: the statement sequence to execute for each item
    finally: called after all items have been iterated over

  Result:
    the result value of the finally-function

  To start the next iteration the *body* must tail-call <std::next>.

  To exit from the loop the *body* must tail-call <std::break>.

  Example:

    $numbers list(1 2 3 4 5)

    for_each numbers
      : (number)
	println! number
	next!
      pass

  Output:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
