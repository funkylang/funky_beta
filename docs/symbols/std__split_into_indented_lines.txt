# std::split_into_indented_lines (a function)

  splits a text into indented lines

  The result is a list of tuples with two fields:

  * indent

  * text_line

  The *text_line* still contains the trailing line feed but leading whitespace
  is removed.

  If a line does not contain any text (whitespace does not count as text) then
  the whole tuple is replaced with the special value <undefined>.

  Example:

    $text "
      a
        1
        2
        3
      b
        4
        5
    $lines split_into_indented_lines(text)
    dump! 3 lines

  Output:

    lines:
      list
        tuple
          0
          "a@0xa;"
        tuple
          2
          "1@0xa;"
        tuple
          2
          "2@0xa;"
        tuple
          2
          "3@0xa;"
        tuple
          0
          "b@0xa;"
        tuple
          2
          "4@0xa;"
        tuple
          2
          "5@0xa;"
