# std::neutral_element_of (a polymorphic function)

  returns the neutral element for the type of its argument

  Parameter:
    self: the object from which to get the neutral element

  Result:
    neutral_element: the neutral element

  The neutral element is the element that, when combined with any other
  element using the appropriate operation, leaves the other element unchanged.

  For example, the neutral element for addition is 0, because adding 0 to any
  number does not change the number.
