# std_types::value_range/std::map_reduce (a method)

  combines a map and a reduce operation into a single operation

  Parameters:
    self: the value-range to build the "sum" from
    map_function: the function to apply to each element of the value-range
    reduce_function: the function to apply to pairs of values

  Result:
    value: the result of the reduce operation

  The map_reduce operation is equivalent to

    reduce map(self map_function) reduce_function

  but is more efficient.
