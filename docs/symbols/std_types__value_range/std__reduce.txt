# std_types::value_range/std::reduce (a method)

  computes a kind of sum from the items of a value-range

  Parameters:
    self: the value-range to build the "sum" from
    function: the function to apply to pairs of values

  Result:
    value: the "sum"

  There is no guarantee in which order the values will be reduced (folded).

  So the the reduction function must obey to the law of assosiativity!
