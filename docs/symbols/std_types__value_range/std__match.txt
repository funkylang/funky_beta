# std_types::value_range/std::match (a method)

  matches the start of the stream with the value-range

  Parameters:
    self: the value-range to match
    stream: the stream to match against

  Results:
    length: the number of matched characters (or <undefined> on fail)
    capture: the matched string (if requested)

  Attempts to match the start of the stream with the specified value-range.

  If the match is successful the length of the match (= the length of the
  string) is returned.

  If the caller requested two result values then in addition to the string
  length the string itself ("the capture") is also returned.

  If the match fails then one or two <std::undefined>-values are returned.
