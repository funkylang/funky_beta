# std::hash (a polymorphic function)

  returns a hash value

  Parameter:
    object: the object to be hashed

  Result:
    hash: an integer hash value

  The returned integer number will always be the same for an object. The
  returned number should not depend on the platform the program is running!

  It must be computed from the object's contents solely!

  Output:
