# std_types::generic_array/std::reduce (a method)

  computes a kind of sum from the items of the array

  Parameters:
    self: the array to work on
    reduce_function: the function to apply to pairs of values
    _unit: the value to return for empty arrays

  Result:
    value: the result of the reduction

  There is no guarantee in which order the values will be reduced (folded).

  So the the reduction function must obey to the law of assosiativity!
