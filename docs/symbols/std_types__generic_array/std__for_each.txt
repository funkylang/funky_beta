# std_types::generic_array/std::for_each (a method)

  iterates over all items of the array

  Parameters:
    self: the array to iterate over
    body: the statement sequence to execute for each item
    finally: called after all items have been iterated over

  For each item the statement sequence supplied as *body* is called
  with one or two arguments (depending on *body*'s parameter count).

  If called with two arguments the first argument is the position number
  of the item within the array.

  To start the next iteration of the loop a tail call to the *next*-function
  has to be performed.

  The loop is exited when the end of the loop is reached without calling
  the *next*-function.

  This is a sequential loop.
