# std::readln_from (an I/O-function)

  reads a line from the specified file descriptor

  Parameter:
    fd: the file descriptor to read from

  Results:
    the read line (without the trailing newline)

  **Attention**: This function must be called with I/O-access rights!

  The function reads data from the file descriptor until a newline character
  is found and returns the read data as a string. The newline character is
  included in the returned string.

  If the end of the file is reached, the function returns the already read
  data as a string.

  If an error occurs, the function returns the error.
