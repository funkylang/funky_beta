# std_types::binary_table/std::reduce (a method)

  computes a kind of sum from the values stored in the table

  Parameters:
    self: the table to build the "sum" from
    function: the function to apply to pairs of values
    unit: the value to return for empty tables

  Result:
    sum: the "sum" of the values stored in the table

  There is no guarantee in which order the values will be reduced (folded).

  So the the reduction function must obey to the law of assosiativity!
