  reads data from a file descriptor until a sentinel is found

  Parameters:
    fd: the file descriptor to read from
    sentinel: the sentinel to search for

  **This function must be called with I/O-access rights!**

  The function reads data from the file descriptor until the specified
  sentinel is found and returns the read data as a string. The sentinel is
  included in the returned string.


  If the <nth> parameter is specified, the function returns the data up to

  If the end of the file is reached, the function returns the already read
  data as a string.

  If an error occurs, the function returns the error.
