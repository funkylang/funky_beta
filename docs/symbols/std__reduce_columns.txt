# std::reduce_columns (a polymorphic function)

  reduces the columns of a table

  Parameters:
    self: the table to reduce
    reduction: a function that takes two arguments and returns a single value

  Result:
    a table with the same number of rows as the original table, but with only one column

  The reduction function is applied to each column of the table,
  starting with the first column. The result of the reduction function
  for each column is then placed in a new column.
