# std_types::bresenham_iterator/std::next_value (a method)

  returns the next value of the iterator

  Parameters:
    self: the iterator

  Results:
    iterator: the updated iterator
   value: the next value

  This method returns the next value of the iterator. If the iterator is called
  more often than the *count* value specified in its creation it will keep
  producing values. So it's up to the caller to restrict the numer of calls to
  the iterator.

  The last (valid) value will always equal the *end* value specified when the
  iterator was created.

  Example:

    count 5
    $start 4
    $end 11

    $iter bresenham(count start end)
    loop:
      next_value &iter $value
      println! value
      if
	value < end
	next
	:
	  println! "done"

  Output:

    4
    6
    7
    9
    11
    done
