# debug::string (a builtin function)

  returns a string representation of the given object

  Parameters:
    object: the object to be converted to a string
    indent = 0: the base indentation to use
    depth = 1: the desired level of detail (recursion depth)

  This function uses introspection to display the object's attributes.

  The returned string can contain multiple lines and is always terminated
  with a line feed.

  A negative indent is the same as a positive indent; but for multi-line
  results the result string starts with a line feed.
