# std::reduce_rows (a polymorphic function)

  reduces a list of lists (a table) row-wise

  Parameters:
    self: the table to reduce
    reduction: a function that takes two arguments: the current row and the
      accumulated result

  Result:
    a list containing the reduced rows

  The reduction function is applied to each row of the table. The first
  argument to the reduction function is the current row, and the second
  argument is the accumulated result from the previous rows.

  The initial value of the accumulated result is undefined.
