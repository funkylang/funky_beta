# std_types::generic_list/std::for_each (an I/O-method)

  iterates over all items of the list

  For each item the statement sequence supplied as *body* is called
  with one or two arguments (depending on *body*'s parameter count).

  If called with two arguments the first argument is the position number
  of the item within the list.

  To start the next iteration of the loop a tail call to the *next*-function
  has to be performed.

  The loop is exited when the end of the loop is reached without calling
  the *next*-function.

  This is a sequential loop.

  Example:

    $persons list("Peter" "Mary" "Paul" "John" "David" "Emma")

    for_each persons: (person)
      writeln! person
      next

  Output:

    Peter
    Mary
    Paul
    John
    David
    Emma

  Example:

    $persons list("Peter" "Mary" "Paul" "John" "David" "Emma")

    $total_length 0
    $hash_sum 0
    for_each persons
      : (person)
        plus &total_length length_of(person)
        plus &hash_sum hash(person)
        next
      -> !total_length !hash_sum
    writeln "total length: " total_length
    writeln "hash sum: " hash_sum

  Output:

    total length: 26
    hash sum: 17062575543
