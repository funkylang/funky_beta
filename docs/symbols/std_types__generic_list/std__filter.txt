# std_types::generic_list/std::filter (a method)

  returns a collection containing all the items that fullfill the
  filter-condition

  Parameters:
    self: the collection to filter
    test: the filter-condition

  Results:
    good: the collection of items that fullfill the filter-condition
    bad: the collection of items that do not fullfill the filter-condition

  If the caller requests two result values then the items are divided into
  two collections: the first collection contains all items that fullfill the
  filter-condition; the second collection contains all items that do not
  fullfill the filter-condition.

  If the caller requests only one result value then the result is a
  collection containing all items that fullfill the filter-condition.
