# std_types::generic_list/std::map_reduce (a method)

  combines a map and a reduce operation into a single operation

  Does not create an intermediate list to hold the "mapped" values.

  Parameters:
    self: the list to work on
    map_function: the function to apply to each element of the list
    reduce_function: the function to apply to pairs of values
    unit: the value to return for empty lists

  Results:
    list: the list of "mapped" items
    value: the reduction of the "mapped" items

  If the caller requests two result values then the list of "mapped" items
  is returned as the first result value and the reduction of the "mapped"
  items as the second result value.

  If the caller requests only one result value then the reduction of the
  "mapped" items is returned.
