# std_types::association_list (a type)

  a very primitive kind of a table

  Associations lists are suited for very small collections. Their main
  advantage is that the items need only support the <equal>-method.
  Neither <less>- or <hash>-methods are used.

  Topics: Tables, Collections

  See also: std_types::table, std_types::hash_table,
            std_types::key_order_table

  Example:

    $ages empty_association_list

    !ages("Tom") 5
    !ages("Sam") 3
    !ages("Sarah") 11

    for_each ages: (name age)
      writeln! name ": " age
      next

  Output:

    Sarah: 11
    Sam: 3
    Tom: 5
