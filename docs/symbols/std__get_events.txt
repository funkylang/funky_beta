# std::get_events (a polymorphic function)

  retrieves events from the input-output object.

  Parameters:

  * WRITE_FAILED: a write failed event

  Example:

    $io std_types::io # create an input-output object
    start_reading_from &io STDIN_FILENO # register reading from STDIN
    write &io STDOUT_FILENO "Please enter some text:@nl;"
      # write a prompt text to STDOUT
    $input_buffer "" # create an initially empty input buffer

    loop: # the event loop
      get_events! &io $events # get one or more events
      for_each events # handle all received events
	: (event)
	  event $type $fd $argument # destru
