# std::range (a polymorphic function)

  returns a subrange of a collection

  Parameters:
    collection # the collection to be analyzed
    start # the first item to be included
    end # the first item to be excluded

  Result:
    range # the subrange

  The first argument specifies the collection.

  The second argument specifies the first index of the first item to include
  in the subrange.

  The third argument specifies the last index of the first item to include in
  the subrange.

  It is okay if the subrange is empty:

  *first_index* == *last_index* + 1

  It is an error if the size of the subrange would be negative:

  *first_index* > *last_index* + 1

  If an index is negativ it is counted from the end of the collection.

  So -1 denotes the last item of the collection, -2 denotes the next-to-last
  item and so on.
