# std::equal (a polymorphic function)

  compares two objects for equality

  Parameters:
    left: the left operand
    right: the right operand

  Result:
    equal: true if left and right are equal, false otherwise

  Two objects are equal if the equal function says so ... ^^

  Two identical objects should always be equal.

  <std::undefined> should only be equal to itself and to no other object.

  There is no separate function to test non-equality.

  *a* != *b*

  is converted by the compiler to

  <std::not>(<std::equal>(*a* *b*))
