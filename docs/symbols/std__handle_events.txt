# std::handle_events (a function)

  handles a list of events

  Parameters:
    io: the input-output object
    events: a list of events

  Result:
    io: the (maybe) modified input-output object
    new_events: a list of new events

  The function calls the event handlers for each event.

  Topic: Input-Output Events

            std::deregister_all_handlers

  Example:

    $io std_types::io # create an input-output object
    start_reading_from &io STDIN_FILENO # register reading from STDIN
    write &io STDOUT_FILENO "Please enter some text:@nl;"
      # write a prompt text to STDOUT
    $input_buffer "" # create an initially empty input buffer

    loop: # the event loop
      get_events! &io $events # get one or more events
      for_each events # handle all received events
        : (event)
          event $type $fd $argument # destructure the event
          case type # check the event type
            READ: # event is a read event
              case fd # check the file descriptor
                STDIN_FILENO: # it was a read event from STDIN
                  append &input_buffer argument
                    # append the received data to the input buffer
                  handle_input! io &input_buffer # call the input handler
                  if
                    io.is_undefined:
                      #
                        the input handler returned undefined to indicate
                        that the input processing is finished
                      terminate! # terminate the program
                    next # otherwise continue processing the events
                next # ignore read events for other file descriptors
            READ_FAILED: # event is a read error
              Error! "Error reading from standard input!"
            WRITE_PENDING: # event is a write pending event
              # ignore
              next! # continue processing the events
            WRITE_COMPLETED: # event is a write completed event
              # ignore
              next! # continue processing the events
            next # ignore all other events
        next # check for more events
