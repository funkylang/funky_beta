[GUIDELINES]

All documentation remarks must have

* a single short (single line) description written in lower case

* a parameter(s) section (if appropriate)

* a result(s) section (if appropriate)

* a detailed description of how to use the symbol: when describing unique
  items of constants, describe how to use them;
  do not repeat yourself

* one or more associated topic(s) (if appropriate)

* a "See also" entry - mention only a view relevant symbols here

Do not mention unknown symbols!

Do not mention more than 10 symbols in the "See also" entry.

DO NOT MENTION MORE THAN 10 SYMBOLS IN THE "See also" ENTRY!

Do not mention internal details of functions.

Do not start each sentence in the description with "If" or "The".

DO NOT START EACH SENTENCE IN THE DESCRIPTION WITH "If" OR "The"!

Do not tell the user what a function does not do.

When referring to another symbol write it enclosed in angle brackets, e.g.
<std::clear>.

The "self"-parameter is a normal parameter like any other and should be
mentioned in the the parameter description.

Replace symbolic constants by their value.

Operations on I/O-objects are not executed immediately but queued as jobs.
To identify a job, an "id" is used.

I/O-functions and I/O-methods either need I/O-access rights or propagate
them ("if", "for_each", etc.).

An "example" section, if available, must use Funky syntax and shall not be too
long.

If there is an appropriate example in the source code then use this example
in the "example" section!

      right # the right operand

    Result:
      equal # true if left and right are equal, false otherwise

    Two objects are equal if the equal function says so ... ^^

    Two identical objects should always be equal.

    <std::undefined> should only be equal to itself and to no other object.

    There is no separate function to test non-equality.

      right # the right operand

    Result:
      less # true if left is smaller than right, false otherwise

    The two objects must be of a comparable type.

    This function is used to implement the following comparison operators:

    *a* < *b*

    is converted by the compiler to

    <std::less>(*a* *b*)

    *a* > *b*

    is converted by the compiler to

    <std::less>(*b* *a*)

    *a* <= *b*

    is converted by the compiler to

    <std::not>(<std::less>(*b* *a*))

    *a* >= *b*

    <std::not>(<std::less>(*a* *b*))

POLY std::shift_left
  #
    bitwise shift-left operation

    Parameters:
      value # the value to be shifted
      shift # the number of bits to shift

    Result:
      shifted # the shifted value

    The first operand (must be positive integer) is shifted left by the number
    of bits specified by the second operandt, that must be a positive integer,
    too.

    The first operand (must be positive integer) is shifted right by the number
    of bits specified by the second operandt, that must be a positive integer,
    too.

    Bits that are shifted out on the right side are "lost".

    There is no restriction in the size of the integer numbers!

POLY std::is_empty
  #
    checks whether a collection contains any items

    Parameter:

  #
    returns the number of items within a collection

    Parameter:
      collection # the collection to be analyzed

    Result:
      length # the number of items within collection

    Many collections just store this value explicitely, making this a very cheap
    operation.

    But there are collections which must traverse all its contents to compute
    the total number of stored items, making this a very expensive operation!

    returned number might not depend on the platform the program is running!

    It must be computed from the object's contents solely!

POLY std::range
  #
    returns a subrange of a collection

      collection # the collection to be analyzed
      start # the first item to be included
      end # the first item to be excluded

    Result:
      range # the subrange

    The first argument specifies the collection.

    The second argument specifies the first index of the first item to include
    in the subrange.

    The third argument specifies the last index of the first item to include in
    the subrange.

    It is okay if the subrange is empty:

    *first_index* == *last_index* + 1

    It is an error if the size of the subrange would be negative:

    *first_index* > *last_index* + 1

    If an index is negativ it is counted from the end of the collection.

    So -1 denotes the last item of the collection, -2 denotes the next-to-last
    item and so on.
