# std::schedule (a polymorphic function)

  schedules a function to be executed later

  Parameters:
    io # the input-output object
    time # timeout or point in time
    function # the function to schedule
    data = undefined # the data to pass to the function

  Result:
    io: the updated input-output object
    job_no: the job number

  Schedules a function to be executed later.

  The function will be executed after the specified time has elapsed.

  If the time parameter is a number, it is interpreted as a timeout in
  milliseconds. If the time parameter is a date and time, the function will be
  executed at that specific point in time.
