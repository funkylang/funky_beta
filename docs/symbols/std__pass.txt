# std::pass (a builtin function)

  does nothing

  *pass* must be called without any arguments and expecting no results.

  It is mostly used as a placeholder for not yet implemented functionality or
  in places where a function is expected by the caller.

  Example:

    $items list("apples" "bananas" "cherries")
    for_each items
      : (item)
	println! item
	next!
      pass # <for_each> expects a "finally" function

  Output:

    apples
    bananas
    cherries
