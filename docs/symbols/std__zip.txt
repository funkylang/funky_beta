# std::zip (a polymorphic function)

  merges two collections

  Parameters:
    left: the first collection
    right: the second collection

  Result:
    a new collection containing the merged items

  All odd numbered items are taken from the first collection; all even
  numbered items from the second collection.

  If a collection runs out of items the remaining items of the other
  collection are simply appended.
