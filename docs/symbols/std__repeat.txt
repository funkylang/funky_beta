# std::repeat (an I/O-function)

  invokes a statement sequence for a specific number of times

  Parameters:
    n: how often to invoke *body*
    body: the statement sequence to invoke
    finally: a function to return selected variables to the caller

  Results:
    the result of the *finally* function

  Attention: This function supports I/O-access rights!

  The statement sequence *body* is invoked exactly *n* times.

  *n* must be a numeric value. If it is not greater than 0 than *body* will
  not be called at all. *n* might also be a negative number (in which case
  *body* will not be called).

  To start the next iteration of the loop a tail call to the *next*-function
  has to be performed.

  To exit from the loop a tail call to the *break*-function has to be
  performed or one or more results have to be returned.

  Example:

    repeat 10:
      print! '*'
      next!
    println!

  Output:

    **********

  Example:

    $value 1
    $n 1
    $result
      repeat
	10
	:
	  inc &n
	  times &value n
	  if
	    value > 100
	    -> value
	    next
	  -> value
      println! result

  Output:

    120

  Example:

    $value 1
    $n 1
    $result
      repeat
	10
	:
	  inc &n
	  times &value n
	  if
	    value > 1'000'000
	    -> value
	    next
	  -> value
      println! result

  Output:
