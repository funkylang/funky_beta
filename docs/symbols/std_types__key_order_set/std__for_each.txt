# std_types::key_order_set/std::for_each (an I/O-method)

  iterates over all items of the key order set

  For each item the statement sequence supplied as *body* is called
  with one argument or none argument at all
  (depending on *body*'s parameter count).

  If called with one argument the argument is the *key*.

  This is a sequential loop.

  Example:

    $adult empty_key_order_set

    !adult("Tom") true
    !adult("Sam") false
    !adult("Sarah") true

    for_each adult: (name)
      writeln! name
      next

  Output:

    Sarah
    Tom
