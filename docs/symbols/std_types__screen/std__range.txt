# std_types::screen/std::range (a method)

  returns a subrange of a screen

  Parameters:
    self: the screen to be analyzed
    x1: the first column to be included
    y1: the first row to be included
    x2: the first column to be excluded
    y2: the first row to be excluded

  Result:
    range: the subrange

  The first argument specifies the screen.

  The second and third arguments specify the first column and row of the first
  item to include in the subrange.

  The fourth and fifth arguments specify the last column and row of the first
  item to include in the subrange.

  It is okay if the subrange is empty:

  *x1* == *x2* && *y1* == *y2*

  It is an error if the size of the subrange would be negative:

  *x1* > *x2* || *y1* > *y2*

  If an index is negativ it is counted from the end of the screen.

  So -1 denotes the last item of the screen, -2 denotes the next-to-last
  item and so on.
