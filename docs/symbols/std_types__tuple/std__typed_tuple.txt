# std_types::tuple/std::typed_tuple (a builtin method)

  clones the specified tuple and replace its contents

  The first argument is used as a prototype which supplies the methods for
  the newly created tuple. All items of the prototype tuple are replaced
  with the specified items. You must supply as many items as the prototype
  tuple contains.

  Parameters:
    prototype: the prototype for the new list
    first_item: the first item of the new tuple
    ...
    last_item: the last item of the new tuple

  Result:
    new_tuple: a new tuple with the specified items

  Topic: Collections

  See also: list

  Example:

    # create a new tuple with the same type as the prototype tuple
    # and the specified items
    new_tuple = prototype_tuple.typed_tuple(item_1, item_2, item_3)
