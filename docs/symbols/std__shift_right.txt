# std::shift_right (a polymorphic function)

  bitwise shift-right operation

  Parameters:
    value: the value to be shifted
    shift: the number of bits to shift

  Result:
    shifted: the shifted value

  The first operand (must be positive integer) is shifted right by the number
  of bits specified by the second operandt, that must be a positive integer,
  too.

  Bits that are shifted out on the right side are "lost".

  There is no restriction in the size of the integer numbers!
