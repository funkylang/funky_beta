# std_types::bresenham_delta_iterator/std::next_value (a method)

 returns the next value of the iterator

  Parameters:
    self: the iterator

  Results:
    iterator: the updated iterator
    value: the next value

  This method returns the next value of the iterator. If the iterator is called
  more often than the *count* value specified in its creation it will keep
  producing values. So it's up to the caller to restrict the numer of calls to
  the iterator.

  The sum of all values returned during the first *count* calls will equal the
  *amount* value specified when the iterator was created.

  Topics: Iterators

  Example:

    count 5
    $amount 7

    $iter bresenham_delta(count amount)
    repeat count:
      next_value &iter $value
      println! value
      next!

  Output:

    1
    2
    1
    2
    1
