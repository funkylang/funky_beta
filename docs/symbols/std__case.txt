# std::case (an I/O-function)

  executes the function associated with the first matching value

  Parameters:
    expr: the value to compare
    values_and_bodies*: an alternating sequence of values and functions

  Results:
    the results of the executed function

  This function supports I/O-access. If it is called with I/O-access rights than
  these access rights are passed on to the executed function.

  The first argument is a value that is compared to the values of the
  following arguments.

  The arguments are an alternating sequence of values and functions (statement
  sequences).

  The values are compared to the first argument in the order they appear.

  If a value matches the first argument, the corresponding function is called.

  If no value matches the first argument, the last function (if any) is called.

  Example:

    $chr 'H'
    case chr
      'a' .. 'z':
	println! "lower case character"
      'A' .. 'Z':
	println! "upper case character"
      '_':
	println! "underscore"
      '0' .. '9':
	println! "digit"
      :
	println! "neither character nor digit nor underscore"

  Output:

    upper case character

  Example:

    $chr 'H'
    $character_class
      case chr
	'a' .. 'z' -> "lower case character"
	'A' .. 'Z' -> "upper case character"
	'_' -> "underscore"
	'0' .. '9' -> "digit"
	-> "neither character nor digit nor underscore"
    println! character_class

  Output:

    upper case character
