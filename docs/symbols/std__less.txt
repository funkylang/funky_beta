# std::less (a polymorphic function)

  compares two objects in an object specific way

  Parameters:
    left: the left operand
    right: the right operand

  Result:
    less: true if left is smaller than right, false otherwise

  The two objects must be of a comparable type.

  This function is used to implement the following comparison operators:

  *a* < *b*

  is converted by the compiler to

  <std::less>(*a* *b*)

  *a* > *b*

  is converted by the compiler to

  <std::less>(*b* *a*)

  *a* <= *b*

  is converted by the compiler to

  <std::not>(<std::less>(*b* *a*))

  *a* >= *b*

  is converted by the compiler to

  <std::not>(<std::less>(*a* *b*))
