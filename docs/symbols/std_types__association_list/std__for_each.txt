# std_types::association_list/std::for_each (an I/O-method)

  iterates over all items of the association list

  For each item the statement sequence supplied as *body* is called
  with one or two arguments (depending on *body*'s parameter count).

  If called with two arguments the first argument is the *key* and the
  second argument the corresponding *value*.

  If called with one argument then only the *value* is supplied.

  This is a sequential loop.

  Example:

    $ages empty_association_list

    !ages("Tom") 5
    !ages("Sam") 3
    !ages("Sarah") 11

    for_each ages: (name age)
      writeln! name ": " age
      next

  Output:

    Sarah: 11
    Sam: 3
    Tom: 5
