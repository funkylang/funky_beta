# std_types::octet_string (a builtin type derived from std_types::string)

  a string where all characters fit into an octet

  This kind of string can be used for input/output-operations.

  Parameters:
    index: the index of the character
    value: the new value (only for updates)

  Result:
    value_or_string: the value at the specified position or the updated string

  Updates to strings are delayed until the string is read.

  String indices are one-based.
