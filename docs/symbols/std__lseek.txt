# std::lseek (a builtin I/O-function)

  repositions the read/write file offset of the open file description
  associated with the specified file descriptor

  Parameters:
    fd: the file descriptor
    offset: the number of bytes to offset
    whence: the position used as reference for the offset

  Result:
    the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from the beginning of
    the file

  The whence parameter can be one of the following:

  * std::SEEK_SET: the offset is set to the value of the offset parameter
  * std::SEEK_CUR: the offset is set to its current location plus the value of
    the offset parameter
  * std::SEEK_END: the offset is set to the size of the file plus the value of
    the offset parameter

  This function needs I/O-access rights.

    open! $fd "test.txt" "w+"
    write! $bytes_written fd "Hello, World!"
    on bytes_written.is_an_error: Error! "Failed to write to file!"
    lseek! $offset fd 0 std::SEEK_SET
    on offset.is_an_error: Error! "Failed to seek to beginning of file!"
    close! fd
