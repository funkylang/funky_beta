# std::or (a polymorphic function)

  performs a "short cut" or-operation

  Parameters:
    left: <std::true> or <std::false>
    right: a function that evaluates to <std::true> or <std::false>

  Results:
    the result of the right function if the left argument is <std::false>,
    otherwise <std::true>

  The "short cut" means that the right function is only evaluated if the
  left argument is <std::false>.

  Example:

    $x 5
    println!
      if
        x > 3
        -> "x is larger than 3"
        -> "x is not larger than 3"

    Output:

      x is larger than 3

    Example:

      $x 2
      println!
        if
          x > 3
          -> "x is larger than 3"
          -> "x is not larger than 3"

    Output:

      x is not larger than 3
