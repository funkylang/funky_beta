# std_types::wide_string (a builtin type derived from std_types::string)

  a sequence of zero or more 32-bit characters

  The type function supports positive and negative indices from
  1 to the length of the sequence starting at the left or form -1 to
  -length of the sequence starting at the right.

  If due to replacement there is no more 32-character in the string it is
  automatically replaced with a <std_types::wide_string>.

  Example:

    $a wide_string("Hello, world!")
    println! a(1)
    println! a(-1)
    println! a(11)
    println! a(-11)
    a(1) "H"
    a(-1) "!"
    a(11) ","
    a(-11) "H"
