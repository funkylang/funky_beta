# std_types::line (a type)

  a tuple with two fields (indent and text)

  The *text_line* still contains the trailing line feed but leading whitespace
  is removed.

  If a line does not contain any text (whitespace does not count as text) then
  the whole tuple is replaced with the special value <std::undefined>.

  Topics: Strings

  Example:

    $text "
      a
	1
	2
	3
      b
	4
	5
    $lines split_into_indented_lines(text)
    dump! 3 lines

  Output:

    lines:
      list

	  0
	  "a@0xa;"
	tuple
	  2
	  "1@0xa;"

	  "3@0xa;"
