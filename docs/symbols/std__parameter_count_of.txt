# std::parameter_count_of (a polymorphic function)

  returns the number of arguments to use when calling its function

  Parameter:
    function: the function to be analyzed

  Result:
    count: the number of arguments the function expects

  This attribute returns the number of arguments to use when calling its
  function. Functions that accept a variable number of arguments will return
  <std::undefined>.

  **Attention**: Functions accepting a variable number of arguments might have
  a minimum and/or maximum number of expected arguments. These numbers **cannot** be
  retrieved during runtime!
