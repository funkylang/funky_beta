# std_types::io/std::generate_uuid (a method)

  generates a UUID asynchronously

  Parameters:
    io: the I/O-object
    id: a caller supplied id to identify the I/O-job
    kind: the kind of UUID to generate (one of std::RANDOM_BASED_UUID,
	  std::TIME_BASED_UUID, or std::NAME_BASED_UUID)

  Result:
    the updated I/O-object

  This function adds a job for generating a UUID to the I/O-object.
  The job is executed asynchronously within <std::get_events>.

  When the UUID has been generated successfully, a
  <std::JOB_COMPLETED>-event is generated.

  If the UUID cannot be generated, a <std::JOB_FAILED>-event is
  generated.

  Example:

    $UUID .

    $io std_types::io

    generate_uuid &io UUID RANDOM_BASED_UUID

    loop:
      get_events! &io $events
      handle_events &io &events
      handle_app_events !io events
      next!

    $handle_app_events: (events)
      for_each events
	: (event)
	  event $type $id $data

	    JOB_COMPLETED:
	      if
		id == UUID:
		  write &io STDERR_FILENO "
		    received UUID @(data)
		  exit &io EXIT_SUCCESS
		  next
		next
	    JOB_FAILED:
	      if
		id == UUID:
		  write &io STDERR_FILENO "
		    failed to receive a UUID
		  exit &io EXIT_FAILURE
		  next
