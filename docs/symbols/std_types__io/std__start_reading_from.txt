# std_types::io/std::start_reading_from (a method)

  starts reading from a file descriptor

  Parameters:
    self: the I/O-object
    fd: the file descriptor
    do_close: whether to close the file descriptor when reading is done
    max_length: the maximum number of bytes to read

  Result:
    self: the updated I/O-object

  This starts reading from the specified file descriptor. The I/O-object will
  generate a <std::READ> event whenever data is available.

  <std::READ_FAILED> will be created.

  When the *do_close* option is specified and no more data is available or an
  error occurred then the file will be closed.
