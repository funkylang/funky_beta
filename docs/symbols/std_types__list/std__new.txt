# std_types::list/std::new (a builtin method)

  clones the specified list and replace its contents

  Both arguments are lists. The first argument is used as a prototype which
  supplies the methods for the newly created list. Any list items of the
  prototype list are discarded. Instead all list items of the second argument
  are used as the contents of the newly created list.

  Parameters:
    prototype: the prototype for the new list
    contents: a list containing the new list's items

  Result:
    new_list: a new list with the same methods as the prototype list
