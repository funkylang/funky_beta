# std_types::many/std::search (a method)

  searches for the nth occurrence of an expression

  Parameters:
    self: the grammar object
    str: the string to search
    nth: the nth occurrence to find

  Results:
    pos: the position where the expression was found
    len: the length of the expression

  This method searches for the *nth* occurrence of the expression in the given
  string. If *nth* is negative then the search is done from the end of the
  string backwards; -1 denotes the last occurrence, -2 the second last, and so
  on.

  If the expression is not found then <std::undefined> is returned for *pos* and
  *len*.

  Output:

    pos: 8
    len: 3
