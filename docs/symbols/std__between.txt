# std::between (a polymorphic function)

  returns the substring between two expressions

  Parameters:
    str: the input string
    expr_1: the expression on the left hand side
    expr_2: the expression on the right hand side
    nth: look for the nth occurrence of *expr_1* instead for the first one

  Result:
    string: the substring between the two expressions

  If the string specified as the first argument contains the expression
  specified as the second and third argument in the correct order, the
  substring starting between the two matching expressions is returned.

  If the string does not contain the expressions (or in the wrong order)
  then the empty string is returned.

  An optional fourth argument can be used to match the *nth* occurence of
  the specified expression. If this value is negative then -1 means the
  last occurrence, -2 means the next-to-last occurence and so on.

  The end-expression is **always** the next match after the start-expression.
