# Control Flow

  In Funky there are no classical language elements to control the flow of
  execution. Instead, the flow of execution is controlled by calling functions.

  Polymorphic dispatch (on <true> and <false>) can be used to implement
  conditional execution.

  Recursive function calls can be used to emulate loops.

  Example:

    $a 3
    $b 5
    if
      a > b:
	println! "a is greater than b"
      :
	println! "b is greater or equal to a"

  Output:

    b is greater or equal to a

  Example:

    $i 1
    loop:
      if
	i <= 5:
	  println! i
	  next!
	break

  Output:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
