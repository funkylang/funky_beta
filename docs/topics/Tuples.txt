# Tuples

  In Funky tuples are **not** used to return multiple values from a function
  because this is a builtin feature of Funky.

  Instead tuples are used to represent small "records" of data.

  To create a tuple the tuple "constructor" is called with values for the
  tuple's fields:

  $my_rec <std::tuple>(value_1, value_2, ..., value_n)

  To retrieve a tuple's fields one "destructs" the tuple like this:

  my_rec $field_1 $field_2 ... $field_n

  Tuples might be removed from the standard library in the future and the
  functionality be merged with lists.

  An object derived from <std_types::object> can be used to create a record
  with named fields.
