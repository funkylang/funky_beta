# Input-Output Jobs

More complex input-output operations like loading the contens of a file or
creating a new file with some contents are handled by IO-jobs.

IO-Jobs are identified by an ID which can be freely chosen by the caller.

An ID must support the following methods:

* equal

* hash

In addition some arbitrary *context* data can be supplied. This data will be
returned when the job finishes - either successful (<JOB_COMPLETED>) or
unsuccessful (<JOB_FAILED>).
