# Input-Output

  Input/Output is handled in a special way in Funky.

  I/O-functions must be called with so-called *I/O-access rights*.

  To call a function with I/O-access rights one

  * must already have *I/O-access rights*

  and

  * give them to the called function

  To give *I/O-access rights* to a function it is called with a "!"-suffix.
