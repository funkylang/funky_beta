# Collections

  There are several kinds of collections

  * tuples

  * lists

  * sets

  * bags

  * tables

  Sets, bags and tables come in several variants, that offer specific features.

  Collections have type functions that allow retrieving and "updating"
  individual elements in the collection.

  When a collection is "updated" a new collection is created where the
  element is changed. The original collection is not changed.
