# Branches

  There are no builtin branch instructions in the Funky language.

  Branch "instructions" are functions that are supplied some form of *condition*
  and two or more functions. Based upon the evaluation of the condition, one of
  the supplied functions is called.

  The basic branch instructions of the standard library use polymorphic dispatch
  on the truth values <true> and <false> to implement <if> and <if_not>.

  More complex branches like <cond> or <case> use <if> to check their
  conditions.
