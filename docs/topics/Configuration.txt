# Configuration

  In Funky configuration files are files where each line contains a key-value
  pair.

  Key and value are separated by whitespace only. Remarks and empty lines are
  allowed.

  Example:

    # control commands

    ctrl-a jump_to_next_bookmark
    ctrl-b toggle_bookmark
    ctrl-c copy

((defined in basic/configuration.fky))
