# Environment

  Allows retrieval of information about the operating system's "environment"
  and also about where the Funky tools are installed.

  Example:

    $shared_path
      append
	installation_prefix()
	"/share/funky-" package_version()

    println! shared_path

  Output:

    /usr/local/share/funky-0.0.0

((defined in basic/environment.fky))
