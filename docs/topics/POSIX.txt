# POSIX

  The Funky-API includes most POSIX-function calls.

  The are wrapped in a Funky-style API.

  Funky uses mainly blocking I/O but makes heavy use of the <std::pselect>
  function to make I/O-calls only when non-blocking behaviour is guaranteed.

  In most cases it will be more appropriate to use the <@Input-Output>-API than
  the POSIX-API.
