# Debugging

  **Attention**: Functions in the namespace "debug" are not available in
  production code.

  They can access object details via introspection which is not available in
  production code.

  These functions can also write to *stderr* without needing I/O-acccess rights!
  To do so they prevent parallel code execution.
