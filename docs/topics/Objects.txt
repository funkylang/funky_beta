# Objects

  Everything in Funky is an object - integers, strings, lists, functins, etc.

  But object can only be used as records with named fields (so-called
  attributes).

  In addition to attributes any number of methods can be defined for an object.

  Example:

    <namespace my_types>

     # we must define polymorphic functions to be used as attributes

    $first_name_of ()
    $last_name_of ()

    # now we can define our prototype person (derived from <std_types::object>)

    $my_types::person std_types::object
      .first_name_of undefined
      .last_name_of undefined

    #
      now let's add a method that converts a person into a string
      The polymorphic function <std::to_string> is already defined in the basic
      library

    $my_types::person/to_string: (self)
      append first_name_of(self) " " last_name_of(self)
